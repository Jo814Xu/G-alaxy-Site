		<p>MOBA is a subgenre of RTS(Real Time Strategy Games) where players control their own hero, a character stronger than the AI creep soldiers, and battle with the opposing heros. The game is typically played from a third bird's eye view viewpoint because it gives the player a better view of the chaos of the battlefield instead of focusing on a single thing at a time.</p>
		
		<h3>Map of a MOBA</h3>
		The Map is the most unique game design element of the MOBA games. Below is a map of a typical MOBA game. Yellow lines are the "lanes" where action is focused; blue and red dots are the defensive "towers/turrets" that defend them; light-colored quarter circles are the teams' bases; and blue and red corners are the structures whose destruction claims victory.<br />

		<p>The term "position" here means the farm dependency of the hero which means that position 1 laner will have a way higher item dependency than a position 5 support.</p><br />
