		<p>The sequel to the original Defense of the ancient game. Dota 2 is ran using Valve's source engine 2 which greatly improved the graphics and the fluidity of gameplay compared to the old Warcraft:Frozen Throne's engine. Dota 2 is enjoyed by the veterans of the MOBA genre instead of the casual players because of the high skill floor created by the massive amount of ways players can interact with the game.</p>
		
		<p>Patience is the most important part of learning this game. You must be willing to spend hours and hours reading the Dota2 Wiki to understand what each hero and item does. However as a new player you should't be too stressed out about making bad plays and mistakes and simply play the game to have fun. The video below should give you a general idea of the game.</p>
