				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An independent video game, or an indie game, is a video game that is often created without the financial support of a publisher, although some games funded by a publisher are still considered "indie". Indie games often focus on innovation and rely on digital Indie gaming saw a rise in mainstream popularity in the latter half of the 2000s, primarily due to new online distribution methods and development tools. Some indie games have been very successful financially, such as Undertale, Braid, World of Goo, and Minecraft.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent game developers, team members are generally less than 10 people, the most common is a small team of only one or two people, the workplace is very casual. Unlike commercial games, developing indie games doesn't necessarily give developers revenue. Only a few independent games can be sold using physical channels, and most rely on lower cost digital download modes.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardew Valley is a ranch game for ranch. You have inherited the grandfather's farm in Stardew Valley, but you have only the most basic farm tools and a little money on hand, so you have to start your new life. Can you turn this weedy field into a prosperous home? This is not easy. Since JOJA came to the town, the previous life has changed. The community center, which used to be the most active part of the town, is now ruined. But the valley seems to be full of opportunities, as long as you are willing to work hard, it is possible to make Star Valley more prosperous.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardew Valley is not a difficult video game. You can use it to experience the life on farm, also some interesting adventures in ancient mind holes. You can land, farm, fish, kill monsters in  mind holes and fall in love with neighbors. This is also a time-killing game, whenever you are bored with a labtop, you can start to play it. The pictures of the game are simple, but there are a variety of ways to explore in the valley. Also, in different season, you can gain several special fish and crops.

			<blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Journey playing, the player will control a character in a robe and walk to the top of a distant mountain in the vast desert. On the way, the player can randomly meet another player who has the same journey; although the two can help each other on the road, they can't communicate by voice or text like other games, and they can't see each other's names. The only way to communicate between players is to sing without words. This humming will have an impact on the game world, allowing players to continue the game through the level. The development team is forced to pass the game, let the player feel the smallness and loneliness in the world, and then become a companion with the stranger, so that the player really has an interest to socialize with other players and establish an emotional bond.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character controlled by the player is wrapped in a deep red robes, wearing a black mask and only seeing the eyes. There is a long scarf behind the head of the character. After touching the checkmark in the level, the player's scarf will lengthen, and the runes on the scarf will increase to extend the time and distance of the player's character floating and jumping. Floating needs to consume the luminous runes representing the energy on the scarf, after which the rune light will slowly recover automatically, or the companion can sing the notes to quickly recover, or in the level to contact the fluttering pieces of the cloth to recover. The game scene is also dotted with larger, worn-out strips that players can sing around and turn them into deep red print strips similar to the robes worn by the characters. This is also one of the game's enchanting elements. Transforming these big cloths can have different effects on the game world, such as releasing pieces of cloth, forming bridges, or floating the player. Players also need to use this door to continue the journey. On the way, players will also encounter cloth flying creatures like kites, some of which will lead the players or accompany the players. At the end of the game, there will be hostile rock monsters. If the characters accidentally touch them, the scarf will be pulled off and the player's ability will be reduced.

						The unique art style and excellent animation design are the main reasons for the first impression. The Fortress developer SuperGiant Games has not invested millions of dollars in this game, but they continue to invest a lot. In a few years, in short, this is the story of "a boy and his hammer." After a simple novice teaching, you start to understand the little boy from all angles. You can buy a variety of steampunk-style weapons in the level. , but also get a variety of capabilities.

						FEZ is a 2D platform game set in the 3D world. The goal is to collect blocks and block fragments, all collected to return the world to normal order. In the process of finding these blocks, Gomez moves between game environments by jumping, and other platform elements change along with the level theme.<br/>There are no Boss, no enemies and no penalty in the game. After the player's character dies, he can quickly resurrect. The designer's description of the game is the same kind of relaxation and free game of 'stopping and smelling flowers'. This game pays more attention to this game. The mystery is not the sensitivity of traditional platform games. Developer Phil Fish has also said that most players have not found this 10% of the game fun. Playing the role of Gomez, from a 2D world to the entire universe and even multi-dimensional parallel universe, the fear brought by the unknown vast world can be said to be the most shocking place of FEZ.

						From a tedious game to a character rich enough to compare with Pixar, Klei's survival game has a lot of different game protagonists, and before you actually start the game, their subtext is only "don't starve". Although there is no gorgeous picture, the art style of Don't Starve is very characteristic. The whole game world is hand-painted by Klei Art Department. In a strict sense, the game has no ending, you will eventually meet the one who started you. The person thrown on the desert island, but the more important thing in the game is to see how long you can survive.

						The game is presented to the player from the first-person perspective. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<br/>The story is primarily presented to the player via the voiceover of the game's narrator, who explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.
