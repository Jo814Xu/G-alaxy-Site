	<p1>
		<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask, what is the most popular or most degraded video game in the last decade. The answer may only be the traditional (or plot) rpg. This rpg game is the product of the 1970s, the originator of all video games. Initially people developed it for remote trpg games with friends. The masterpieces of <em>Dragon and Dungeons</em>, <em>Magic Door Series</em> and <em>Endless Winter</em> have pushed the American rpg game to the peak. But that is already the last century. With the development of other e-sports forms, the traditional rpg has become time-consuming and labor-intensive in the hearts of players, and loneliness is awkward. Although the Japanese rpg still has some loyal players in the Asian region, but on a global scale, he can not save the overall decline. The two traditional rpgs and their sequels that we will introduce here are born in 2016 and 2017 respectively. They all got IGN's high scores and even exceeded the million sales. They are <em>Pillar of Eternal 2</em> and <em>The Divinity: original Sin 2</em>.We will focus on Dvinity more, because it adds some fashion and creative features into the game. Also, it is more popular than others.</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like "Desperate: Original Sin", players can play single-player as a team member, or play multiplayer games with three companions. Players can use some of the preset characters directly, or they can create their own characters and set the character's attributes, race, gender and skills.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players can go with up to three teammates, and the mod provided by the Steam Workshop can raise the teammate's limit to six. The teammates in the squad are fully manipulable and will have different interactions with the environment or other NPCs depending on the characteristics of each teammate. Players can split the team and control each group separately, and if used properly, can play a miracle in combat or other environments.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game supports both online multiplayer mode and LAN multiplayer mode, while in multiplayer mode, players can collaborate with each other and compete with each other. The characters controlled by other players in the cooperative mode will replace the teammates in the single player mode, and the competition mode will place the two teams on a map to attack each other. The game also has a skill customization system that allows the player to choose a skill combination with the character to deal with different situations.

			<p3><blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is set on the fantasy world of Rivellon, centuries after the first Divinity. Living beings on Rivellon have a form of energy known as Source, and individuals called Sourcerers can manipulate Source to cast spells or enhance their combat abilities. The Seven Gods of Rivellon had given up a portion of their collective Source power and infused it into a person, Lucian, who became what is known as the Divine, whose role is to use his powers to hold back the Void. However, Lucian died before the start of the game, which weakened the Veil between the Void and Rivellon, and monstrous creatures of the Void known as Voidwoken are beginning to invade Rivellon. Voidwoken are drawn to the use of Source, which has led to the persecution of Sourcerers, primarily by an organization called the Divine Order, whose Magisters enforce their will. The Void is also home to a dark deity known as the God King. At the start of the game, the player character is a Sourcerer who is captured by the Divine Order and sent to an island fortress known as Fort Joy. Fort Joy is a prison for Sourcerers, ostensibly to cure them of their Source powers, but in actuality "purging" the Sourcerers to turn them into mindless husks. During the journey to Fort Joy, a gigantic Kraken Voidwoken attacks and sinks the ship, but the player character is saved from drowning by a mysterious voice, who calls the player "Godwoken".
				</blockquote><br/>
				
				<blockquote>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Godwoken sails to the island of Reaper's Coast, which is also under Divine Order control. There, the Godwoken gradually expands their Source powers until they achieve mastery of Source. The Godwoken also encounters their God again, who instructs the Godwoken to the Well of Ascension, where the Godwoken will be able to absorb enough Source to become Divine. During their time on Reaper's Coast, the Godwoken also learns that Dallis and the Magisters have excavated the Aeteran, a powerful artifact with an infinite capacity for purging Source. Additionally, the Godwoken encounters an immortal being called Aeterna. Aeterna claims that she is a member of a race known as Eternals, who were the original denizens of Rivellon. The Seven Gods were themselves Eternals, but they craved the power to rule as gods. To accomplish this, the Seven betrayed the other Eternals and banished them to the Void, and then created the mortal races of Rivellon in their own likeness, from whom the Gods would be able to drain large amounts of Source and become supremely powerful.
