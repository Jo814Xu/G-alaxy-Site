	<p1>For this group assignment, we are planning on building a website that consists of different types of resources for people that are interested in getting started in the field of gaming. Resources such as guides created by ourselves and the once created by the developers themselves will take up the majority of our website. Videos, artworks, wiki pages and even twitch live streams will also be included to assist those that are completely new to gaming. We want to make the website to be interactive in order to fit the userâ€™s needs. Technical features such as filtering out 18+ content, resizing images or videos, animation of website panels and maybe some creative ways of taking the users to the destinations they want to go will be included. We would also want implement a search engine of our own that could search available game guides by both keyword and genre such as FPS, RPG, Indie, MOBA etc. It is going to be a-lot of work to make a guide for every single game on the market, so it will be the best that we stick to the current gen AAA titles or games with a high rating. General guides for building a gaming pc and definitions of each genre are also helpful guides to have beside the specific game guides. We look forward to learn the skills required to do the above in class.</p1>
	
	<p2>Most of the html element has been added. However, in the upcoming part 3 of the assignment we would like to add in more content that contributes to the CSS styling aspect of the program. We ran short on time and will try to fix our grammar and spelling mistakes in paragraphs and organize the content better with CSS.
	John is responsible The index, anything in the main genre pages, individual games under FPS and MOBA aswell as all audios.
	CoCo is responsible The RPG, Indie, Community pages, and some minor CSS edits and these edits are adapted by John for his parts aswell.
	Javascript is done mostly by John and Jquery is done mostly by Coco.
