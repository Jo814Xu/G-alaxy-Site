			The ancient town of the mountainous region, Yharnam, is a cursed place. The unique local diseases of the plague of monsters have been circulating since ancient times. As in the name of a disease, a patient suffering from this condition will become a beast that loses his mind as a disease name. However, as in the cursed ancient city, it is also said that there are medical techniques that can cure the root of the disease. Most patients with this disease travel long distances to Yharnam and seek ways to rescue them.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player acted a foreign adventurer who came to Yharnam for medical treatment. After receiving blood transfusion under the guidance of an unknown mysterious man, he fell into a dream full of monsters, and then awakened in a strange hospital. At the beginning, the player does not have any items such as props and weapons. It is equal to the state of unarmed and empty fists to explore in the hospital. Soon, the werewolf that I saw in my dreams appeared in front of the player's eyes, and the game was maliciously designed to "make you die once at the beginning" (of course, the player can be alive if he has a very perfect game skills). An unarmed, attacking protagonist who can only inflict 2 to 3 damage will be killed by the werewolf for about two times.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player who died will be sent to the Hunter's Dream, which is the main supply point in this game, and then the death will be sent back here. Players can purchase items and equipment at the Bath Messenger and the ability to upgrade their characters at the inanimate Doll.

		<ul>
			<li> <em>Yharnam</em> </li>
				<ul>
					<li> A lost ancient capital that has been lost. It is a miraculous medical sanctuary and a curse street for the spread of territorial disease. The raging "beast" disease has caused people to lose their humanity and succumb to the way of the beast. The way to treat the disease is said to be hidden in the healing church in Yharnam, and this daunting religion has an incomprehensible worship of the blood. Over the years, many desperate and tormented people have come to Yharnam for help. Our players are the ones who come to Yharnam for medical treatment and are suffering from a disease. But Yharnam has been cursed by a malignant disease, and the protagonist must fight the terrorists in the city to discover the most hidden darkness and horror in the city.
					</li>
				</ul><br/>
			
			<li> <em>Blood Vial</em> </li>
				<ul>
					<li> The scholars of Byrgenwerth University discovered the huge ruins of the underground of Yharnam. When they explored the remains, they discovered the body of the old god buried in the depths. The ancient gods did not die, but fell into deep sleep. So the scholars began to study this thing and found that the blood drawn from it can cure people's diseases. So he created blood therapy and healed the church. By diluting the blood of the old god and injecting it into citizens to help them get rid of the disease, everything is fine.
					</li>
				</ul><br/>
			
			<li> <em>Beast</em></li>
				<ul>
					<li> When Yharnamians received blood therapy, they slowly synchronized with the dreams of the ancient gods. They also fell into a dream. There is also a Yharnam in this dream. It should be said that it is a synchronous projection of Yharnam, and all of them participated unconsciously. People in the blood therapy are immersed in sleep, trapped in its dreams and unable to extricate themselves. Only a few people can find that it is in a dream. In the dream, as the frequency of the ancient gods is getting higher and higher, because of the distortion of the spirit, people Gradually beasting. Those who have become beasts naturally become the targets of "normal people". Because in normal people's sight, the beastized person is a monster.

					Moon Presence is the strongest The Great One, the creator of the hunter's dream. When humans contacted the ancient gods through blood therapy methods, they triggered their interest in human beings, hoping to select a suitable person in humans as a reincarnation. Because it is beyond the understanding of human understanding, Gehrman will be confused by it, and he needs to acquire the wisdom of three third umbilical cords before he can fight against it. The last hidden BOSS, which is the paleblood mentioned in the game. The existence of the Elf of the Moon is more like the realization of the consciousness of the ancient god itself in the dream. When the protagonist defeats the first hunter, it will appear, let the player become the new dream guardian, guard its dream, of course. Players can also choose to use 3 1/3 umbilical cords, successfully possess the power of the new ancient gods and fight against them, and finally replace them.

					The Choir called the Kin outside through special rituals.Through contact with Ebrietas, members of the Choir have gained unprecedented wisdom and artificially created intelligent creatures represented by the Holy Messenger. At the same time, the desperate altar where Ibitas is located is also to guard the spider-like statues with the ability to trace back.

					Amygdala is a giant, ten-limbed monster that resides in the Nightmare Frontier. Referred to as "Lord Amygdala" by Patches the Spider, Amygdala may be behind his transformation into a spider. An NPC with the voice of Patches will bestow upon you the Tonsil Stone if spoken to after the death of Rom. This rock, which looks like Amygdala's head, may be used to gain access to the Nightmare Frontier. Within the Nightmare, Amygdala rests invisibly atop a tower until the player gets close. She drops the Ailing Loran Chalice. In the following quotations, Patches talks about Amygdala or mentions nameless divines.

					The Kin who was hidden in the sea by Master William and has the ability to trace back. Due to the existence of Rom, the bloody moon could not come, and Mergo's plan could not be realized. Therefore, Master William will guard the platform, personally select the right person and give directions to make it unblock and eventually destroy Mergo's plan. From many places in the game, you can find information and documents about the secrets of spiders hiding ceremonies. The master William of Bayer Kings, through this spider, sealed the ritual of the birth of the Great One, which is why he defeated Rom. After the animation will show, immediately into the bloody month, and the Queen of Sumeru and the cry of the baby. Master William passed the power of Rom and sealed it, so that the plan of Mergo and others could not be implemented. Her death released the seal of the ceremony and made a breakthrough in the ritual of the new Kin.
