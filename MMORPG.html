			<p4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1994, the World of Warcraft IP has affected countless game enthusiasts and developers. In fact, the script originally written for the game has been tens of millions of books that have been rewritten into novels. The huge worldview of this story laid the foundation for Blizzard's subsequent development of other related games. Today's popular card game Hearthstone legend, as well as the real-time strategic game Warcraft, dota1/2 are its derivatives. In 2016, Blizzard launched the World of Warcraft movie, which is popular in China. Countless new and old players wear World of Warcraft T-shirts and shout slogans to the cinema. Looking back now, it is still a shocking scene. We believe this game will create more miracles in the future.
