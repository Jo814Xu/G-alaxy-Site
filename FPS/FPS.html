		<h3 style="color: cadetblue" align="center">-- First Person Shooter</h3>
		
		<p1><blockquote>Arguably the most well known genre in this generation of gamers. First person shooter games as the name suggests allows the player to control their character and eliminate enemy targets from a first person point of view. The original purpose of FPS games were made not for entertainment but for computerized military simulations.

On paper, FPS games are easy to play, just point your mouse and click to shoot your gun; but there could be other elements of the game that demends the player's ability to control the recoil of their gun, to avoid map hazards, to use a variety of tools and abilities to give themselves a tactical advantage and so on.

		<h2>Controller and Mouse</h2>
		
		<p2><blockquote>Mouse and controllers are the most common type of user input for FPS games. The main difference between a controller and a mouse is that the mosue uses laser or optical tracking to operate and the controller uses buttons and joysticks to operate. The controller settings are usually more simple and you could just refer to the user manual that comes out of the box with your console. The mouse however usually requires more tuning.</blockquote></p2>
		
		<h3>Adjusting Sensitivity</h3>
		
		<p2><blockquote>In the settings menu of most games, the option to change the sensivity of the mouse or controller will be avaliable. The recommended sensivity will be the one the user is most comfortable with. Players should play around with the settings in practice or testing lobbies in game to find the best sensivity for them. Most mouse users are comfortable with the sensitivity that allows them to turn their character 360 degrees when they drag their mouse across their mousepad, but this is not always the best setting.</blockquote></p2>
		
		<h3>User Interface</h3>
		
		<p3><blockquote>The UI of fps games usually contain the crosshair. The crosshair help the players to accquire their target more easily and the properties of it can often be configured in the game's configuration file. Below is a little tool for generating a custom crosshair.</blockquote></p3>
