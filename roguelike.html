				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video game characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player character. Most roguelikes are based on a high fantasy narrative, reflecting their influence from tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the roguelikes Beneath Apple Manor and Sword of Fargoal predate it, the 1980 game Rogue, which is an ASCII based game that runs in terminal or terminal emulator, is considered the forerunner and the namesake of the genre, with derivative games mirroring Rogue's character- or sprite-based graphics. These games were popularized among college students and computer programmers of the 1980s and 1990s, leading to a large number of variants but adhering to these common gameplay elements, often titled the "Berlin Interpretation". Some of the better-known variants include Hack, NetHack, Ancient Domains of Mystery, Moria, Angband, Tales of Maj'Eyal, and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. The Japanese series of Mystery Dungeon games by Chunsoft, inspired by Rogue, also fall within the concept of roguelike games.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, with more powerful home computers and gaming systems, new variations of roguelikes incorporating other gameplay genres, thematic elements and graphical styles have become popular, typically retaining the notion of procedural generation and permanent death of the player-character. Indie games like Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space, Spelunky, The Binding of Isaac, FTL: Faster Than Light, and Rogue Legacy helped to establish the use of roguelike elements in other genres. These titles are sometimes labeled as "roguelike-like", "rogue-lite", or "procedural death labyrinths" to reflect the variation from titles which mimic the gameplay of traditional roguelikes more faithfully. Other games, like Diablo and UnReal World, key titles in the action role-playing and the survival game genres respectively, took inspiration from roguelikes.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roguelike type of games was clearly defined at the 2008 International Roguelike Development Conference. Among the naming and definition processes, the more frequently occurring features include: <br/>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate randomness. Each new game will randomly generate game scenes, enemies, treasures and other different things. And every adventure of the player will be unique and cannot be copied.<br/>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process is unidirectional. When you are playing a Roguelike game, the only function of the archive function is to record your current game progress. Whenever the archive is read, the corresponding progress is cleared until you make the next archive.<br/>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irreducible. In most Roguelike games, each character has only one life, and the death of one character means that the player will lose the character forever.<br/>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game is non-linear. The rigorous yet flexible rules of the game give Roguelike a high degree of freedom. In the game, players can use their imagination to use whatever means to achieve whatever they want, or to be reasonable, or incredible. It's just to solve the problems they have encountered in the game.<br/>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture is simple. In fact, Rogue, the originator of Roguelike games, is widely regarded as one of the first graphical games of adventure games, although this "graphical interface" is abstract. However, many Roguelike games, because of their tribute to Rogue, will directly use ASCII characters to represent the game screen, and the protagonists of many games will call the same name, @.<br/>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system complexity. The complexity of Rogue itself is far more than any of the works of the same period.

	<p3>
		<blockquote>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy roguelike elements. Players will accompany Isaac on a quest to escape his mother, facing off against droves of mysterious creatures, discovering secrets, and fighting fearsome bosses. Along the way, Isaac can find bizarre treasures that change his form and give him super-human abilities. But it won't be easy!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebirth is the remake of the original game. It sports a game engine that runs at 60 FPS, new pixel style artwork, polished visual effects, and a new soundtrack from Ridiculon. Oh yeah, and hundreds of new rooms, synergies, and re-tuned enhancements by the series creator, Edmund McMillen. There are two DLCs available for Rebirth, The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth and The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth †.<br/>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The binding of Isaac "does not follow the narrative method of the general story. It does not give us a clear explanation. The multiple endings of the game are almost random and inexplicable to most players. In order to understand the story, you must piece together yourself. On the surface, it may seem like an ordinary funny independent game game. Many elements are really ridiculously designed by the author, such as shooting the stool to get the props; urine to look at the BOSS; shooting tears to attack However, "the combination of Isaac" has this serious side under this black humor. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see from the name, the theme of this game is religion. The Binding of Isaac is a biblical story. In the story God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac to be faithful. This is also related to the game story. The narration of the game tells us how Isaac's mother heard "the voice of God" and asked her to offer her son in the same way. But not long after, when we defeated the mother's legs for the first time, we found that the plot of Isaac's mother wants to kill him but was stopped by God is the virtuality of Isaac in the painting. Because the next scene we saw the door, his mother is still alive. So the story has a new suspense, we don't know if Isaac's mother really wants to kill him. But the first part of the story shows that Isaac did not like his mother at all. He hates, even hates and fears her.<br/>
